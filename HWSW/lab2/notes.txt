phase_2
sscanf converts the input string to numbers
these are then stored as arguments in the pointers that are the past arguments to sscanf
eax contains the return value of the function.

after read_six_numbers the results are in the first six words after %rsp.

phase_3:
again, but points further into the format string, so that it only reads two strings.

jmpq   *0x401b60(,%rax,8) 
this is a jump table.
I think %rax is the second argument of the calling sequence.
NOTE: Actually %rax is the return value from the previous syscall.

On this input (with %rax = 2), it jumps to <phase_3+118>.

phase_4
The format is stored in: 0x400ab0
`od -Ax -c bomb` | less shows this to be:
377   % 002 032      \0

phase_5

Something is done with an array at 001ba0
001ba0 000a 0000 0002 0000 000e 0000 0007 0000
001bb0 0008 0000 000c 0000 000f 0000 000b 0000
