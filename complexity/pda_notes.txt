We need to show that
(q, wx, S) ->* (q, x, alpha)
iff S =>* w alpha

basic step:
alpha = S
w = empty
and S =>* S

Inductive step
(q, wx, S) ->* (q, x, alpha)

Type 1: 
(q, yax, S) ->* (q, ax, a alpha) -> (q, x, alpha)
where ya = w.

by the IH:
S =>* ya alpha      
but ya = w, so S =>* w alpha

Type 2:
(q, wx, S) ->* (q, x , A beta) -> (q, x, gamma beta)

where A -> gamma is a production and alpha = gamma beta

by the IH
S =>* wA Beta

Thus:
S =>* w gamma beta = w alpha
