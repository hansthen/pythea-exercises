Descartes studied law in college because 
his dad wanted him to. 
After that, he gave up for awhile on 
books and decided to see the world. 
He had a practice of lying in bed and 
thinking, including about mathematics. 
He had lots of great ideas in math and 
philosophy. 
We're going to focus on just one. 
The story goes he had an idea while lying 
in bed and looking at a fly on the 
ceiling. 
He noticed that he could describe the 
location of the fly by two numbers. 
That is the distance of the fly from two 
walls. 
Two walls making a corner. 
And he realized that this works even when 
the walls were not necessarily 
perpendicular. 
This led him to understand that he could 
formulate Geometric questions using 
algebra. 
Now, the walls play the role of what we 
would now call axes, and the two numbers 
are called coordinates. 
The coordinate representation of a vector 
v, in terms of other vectors a1 through 
an, is the vector of coefficients, the 
vector of numbers alpha 1 through alpha 
n, such that v equals alpha 1 times a1 
and so on, up to alpha n times an. 
In this context, we call the 
coefficients, the numbers in this vector, 
coordinates. 
For example, this vector can be written 
as this linear combination. 
So it's coordinate representation in 
terms of these vectors is the vector of 
coefficients 1, 2, 3. 
So that's it's representation. 
[SOUND] What's the coordinate 
representation of this vector in terms of 
these vectors? 
Well, we can write this vector as this 
linear combination. 
So the coordinate representation is the 
vector consisting of the coefficients, 2, 
2, and minus 1. 
There's one more example. 
What's the coordinate representation of 
this vector in terms of these three 
vectors. 
Here we've expressed this vector as a  
linear combination of these vectors. 
The coefficients are 1, 0 and 1. 
So the coordinate representation is the 
vector 1, 0, 1. 
Now why are we going around putting 
coordinates in the vector? 
It makes sense when you think about the 
linear combinations definition of matrix 
vector multiplication. 
Oh, let A be the matrix whose vectors are 
the columns a1 through an. 
Then, when we say u is the coordinate 
representation of a vector v in terms of 
a1 through an, we can rewrite that as the 
statement that a times u equals v. 
So to go from a coordinate representation 
u, to the vector being represented, say 
v, we multiply a times u. 
I call this rep to vec. 
Now, to go from a vector to its 
coordinate representation, we have to 
solve a matrix vector equation. 
We have to solve A times x equals v, and 
the solution is a coordinate 
representation.
