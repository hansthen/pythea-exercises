A well-established theme of computer 
science is the usefulness of having 
data and being able to transform between 
them. 
In linear algebra, the analogous thing is 
change of basis. 
So, suppose we have a basis a1 through an 
for some vector space big V. 
How do we go from a vector b in big V to 
the coordinate representaiton u of b in 
terms of a1 through an? 
We saw before that by the linear 
combinations definition of matrix vector 
multiplication. 
The coordinate representation satisfies 
this equation. 
The matrix whose columns are the basis 
vectors times the coordinate 
representation equals the original vector 
b. 
We now know by the unique representation 
lemma that u is the only solution to the 
matrix vector equation a times x equals 
b. 
Where a is the matrix with a1 through an 
in its columns. 
So, we can obtain the coordinate 
representation by using a matrix vector 
equation solver. 
Let's define the function that maps from 
F to the n to the vector space big V, by 
f of x equals this matrix times the 
vector x. 
Now, this function is onto, because a1 
through an are generators for the 
co-domain. 
It's also one to one by the unique 
representation lemma. 
So, this function is an invertible 
function. 
Now, let's consider two basis for the 
same vector space, a1 through an and c1 
through ck. 
We define the corresponding functions. 
f of x is this matrix times x, g of y is 
this matrix times y, then both f and g 
are invertible functions by the argument 
we just gave. 
Now, consider the function f inverse 
composed with g. 
This function maps from the coordinate 
representation of a vector in terms of c1 
through ck, to the coordinate 
representation of the same vector in 
terms of a1 through an. 
Now, here's a very important special 
case. 
Where the vector space big V is F to the 
m for some m. 
In that case, the fact that f is 
invertible implies that this matrix is an 
invertible matrix. 
Similarly, the fact that g is invertible 
implies that this matrix is an invertible 
matrix. 
Putting these together. 
The function f inverse composed with g 
has this property. 
That applying f inverse composed with g 
to a vector x is the same as multiplying 
the vector x first by this matrix whose 
columns are c1 through c k. 
And then, by this matrix, the inverse of 
the matrix whose columns are a1 through 
an. 
So, we see that if a1 through an, and c1 
through ck, are both basis for F to the 
m, then multiplication by this matrix maps from the representations of vector 
with respect to c1 through ck to the 
representation of that same vector with 
respect to a1 through an. 
We can conclude the given two bases of F 
to the m, there is some matrix B. 
Such as that multiplication by B converge 
from the coordinate representation which 
is vector one basis, to the coordinate 
representation of the same vector, with 
respect to the other places. 
Now, converting between a vector and its 
representation, can be seen as a special 
case of this process. 
Where we think of the vector itself as 
just the coordinate representation of the 
vector in terms of the standard basis. 
Here is the example. 
We want to map from the coordinate 
representation with respect to these 
vectors to the coordinate representation 
with respect to these vectors. 
We use this matrix. 
It's the product of the inverse of the 
matrix whose columns are the new basis 
times the matrix whose columns are the old 
basis. 
Now, this, this inverse is this matrix, 
so this product is this matrix.
